        <Summary xml:lang="en">bsdiff and bspatch are tools for building and applying patches to binary files.</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">bsdiff and bspatch are tools for building and applying patches to binary files. By using suffix sorting (specifically, Larsson and Sadakane&apos;s qsufsort) and taking advantage of how executable files change, bsdiff routinely produces binary patches 50-80% smaller than those produced by Xdelta, and 15% smaller than those produced by .RTPatch (a commercial patch tool).
This is a fork by user &quot;thoughtpolice&quot; on Github.
